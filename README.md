# Python Hangman Project
By: Steven Joseph S. Ceniza

It is a minigame of hangman that is implemented using python. It simply chooses a random word from a file and lets the player guess the word. Once the word is guessed the player then needs to input his name so that his guess time and the number of the letters that was guessed will be recorded. The fastest guess will be viewed in a game menu provided by the program.
